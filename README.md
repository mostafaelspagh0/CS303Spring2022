Specs:
1. The list should be defined in a separate file (not in App.js)
2. The list should be scrollable.
3. Put as many items as it requires you to demonstrate how the list scrolls.
4. When you press on an item, an alert appears with the text from that item.

Perfection:
1. Add items to list should work.
